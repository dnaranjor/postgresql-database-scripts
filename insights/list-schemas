# The pg_toast_temp schema are for the TOAST tables associated with 
# temp tables. Normal tables may have associated TOAST tables containing 
# out-of-line and/or compressed data. They normally live in the pg_toast 
# schema. To prevent naming conflicts when two temp tables of the same 
# name both have TOAST tables, separate pg_toast_temp schema must be 
# created for them. 

# Don't delete them or mess with them, and just examine the pg_namespace 
# system table with something like: 

select * from pg_namespace where not nspname like 'pg_%'; 

# Si se desea verificar cuantos schemas existen, incluyendo los de sistema:

select * from pg_namespace;
