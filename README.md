# oracle-database-scripts
PostgreSQL Database Server scripts that let us all rest at night
============================================================

This is just an open, Internet-centric repository of all the SQL scripts I've been both developing and finding through the years as an PostgreSQL DBA.

Parallel projects will be Oracle, SQL Server and Sybase ASE scripts.

Collaborations allowed, of course.
