# To rename the db database to newdb, you follow these steps:

# First, disconnect from the database that you want to rename by connecting to another 
# database e.g., postgres. If you use the psql command line, you can use the following command to connect to the postgres database:

\c postgres;

# Next, check the all active connections to the db database by using the following query:

SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'db';

# If the database you want to rename has active connections, terminate all using the following statement:

SELECT pg_terminate_backend (pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname = 'db';

# After that, rename the db database to newdb using the ALTER DATABASE RENAME TO statement as follows:

ALTER DATABASE "db" RENAME TO "newdb";
