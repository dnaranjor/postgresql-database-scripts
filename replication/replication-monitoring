# PostgreSQL has some building blocks for replication monitoring, and the following are some important functions and views which can be use for monitoring the replication:
#
# 1. pg_stat_replication view on master/primary server.
# 
# This view helps in monitoring the standby on Master. It gives you the following details:
# 
# pid:              Process id of walsender process
#   usesysid:         OID of user which is used for Streaming replication.
#   usename:          Name of user which is used for Streaming replication
#   application_name: Application name connected to master
#   client_addr:      Address of standby/streaming replication
#   client_hostname:  Hostname of standby.
#   client_port:      TCP port number on which standby communicating with WAL sender
#   backend_start:    Start time when SR connected to Master.
#  state:            Current WAL sender state i.e streaming
#   sent_location:    Last transaction location sent to standby.
#   write_location:   Last transaction written on disk at standby
#   flush_location:   Last transaction flush on disk at standby.
#   replay_location:  Last transaction flush on disk at standby.
#   sync_priority:    Priority of standby server being chosen as synchronous standby
#   sync_state:       Sync State of standby (is it async or synchronous).
# e.g.:

1. postgres=# select * from pg_stat_replication ;

 2. pg_is_in_recovery() : Function which tells whether standby is still in recovery mode or not.
 
e.g.

postgres=# select pg_is_in_recovery();
 pg_is_in_recovery
-------------------
 t
(1 row)
 
 
 3. pg_last_xlog_receive_location: Function which tells location of last transaction log which was streamed by Standby and also written on standby disk.
 
e.g.

postgres=# select pg_last_xlog_receive_location();
 pg_last_xlog_receive_location
-------------------------------
 0/29004560
(1 row)

4. pg_last_xlog_replay_location: Function which tells last transaction replayed during recovery process. e.g is given below:

postgres=# select pg_last_xlog_replay_location();
 pg_last_xlog_replay_location
------------------------------
 0/29004560
(1 row)
 
5. pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp: This function tells about the time stamp of last transaction which was replayed during recovery. Below is an example:

postgres=# select pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp();
  pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp
----------------------------------
 15-MAY-14 20:54:27.635591 -04:00
